## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Audio Won't Play

**Possible Causes**:
1. Browser autoplay policy
2. Stream URL incorrect
3. AzuraCast server down
4. CORS issues

**Solutions**:
```typescript
// Check browser console for errors
// Verify stream URL in radio-stations.ts
// Test AzuraCast URL directly in browser
// Check API route logs
```

### Issue: Visualizer Not Working

**Possible Causes**:
1. Web Audio API not initialized
2. Audio context suspended
3. No audio data

**Solutions**:
```typescript
// Check if audioData is being received
// Verify analyser node is connected
// Check browser console for Web Audio errors
```

### Issue: Rate Limit Errors

**Possible Causes**:
1. Too many requests
2. Multiple tabs open
3. Testing scripts running

**Solutions**:
```typescript
// Wait 60 seconds
// Close other tabs
// Increase rate limit in route.ts
```

### Issue: Station Won't Switch

**Possible Causes**:
1. Previous audio not stopped
2. State not updating
3. Component not re-rendering

**Solutions**:
```typescript
// Check if stop() is called
// Verify selectedStation state
// Check React DevTools
```

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance

| Metric | Target | Acceptable |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Page Load | < 2s | < 3s |
| Audio Start | < 1s | < 2s |
| Station Switch | < 500ms | < 1s |
| Visualizer FPS | 60fps | 30fps |
| Memory Usage | < 100MB | < 200MB |
| CPU Usage | < 10% | < 20% |

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Logging

Add to `SecureAudioPlayer.tsx`:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Audio Player State:', {
    stationId,
    isActive,
    isPoweredOn,
    isPlaying: state.isPlaying,
    isLoading: state.isLoading,
    error: state.error,
  });
}, [stationId, isActive, isPoweredOn, state]);
```

### Check API Route

Add to `route.ts`:

```typescript
console.log('Stream request:', {
  stationId,
  ip,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

### Monitor Audio Events

Add to audio element:

```typescript
<audio
  onLoadStart={() => console.log('Load start')}
  onCanPlay={() => console.log('Can play')}
  onPlaying={() => console.log('Playing')}
  onError={(e) => console.error('Audio error:', e)}
  onWaiting={() => console.log('Waiting/buffering')}
/>
```
