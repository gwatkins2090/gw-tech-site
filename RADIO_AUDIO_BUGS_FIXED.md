# üîß Radio Stations Audio Playback Bugs - FIXED

## üéØ Summary

Fixed three critical audio playback bugs in the `/stations` page:
1. ‚úÖ **Bug 1:** Power button auto-playing without station selection
2. ‚úÖ **Bug 2:** Double audio when clicking a station
3. ‚úÖ **Bug 3:** Audio artifacts when switching stations

## üêõ Bug 1: Power Button Auto-plays Without Selecting a Station

### **Problem:**
- When clicking the power button, audio started playing immediately
- No station was visually selected (UI showed `--.-` and "No Signal")
- Audio played despite showing "No Signal"

### **Root Cause:**
Multiple `SecureAudioPlayer` components were being rendered (one per station), and the logic wasn't properly preventing playback when no station was selected.

### **Fix Applied:**

**File:** `src/app/stations/page.tsx` (lines 392-402)

**Before:**
```typescript
{/* Audio Players - Hidden but functional */}
{stations.map((station) => (
  <SecureAudioPlayer
    key={station.id}
    stationId={station.id}
    isActive={selectedStation?.id === station.id}
    isPoweredOn={isOn}
    onAudioData={setAudioData}
    onError={(error) => console.error(`Station ${station.id} error:`, error)}
  />
))}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{/* Audio Player - Only render when a station is selected */}
{selectedStation && (
  <SecureAudioPlayer
    key={selectedStation.id}
    stationId={selectedStation.id}
    isActive={true}
    isPoweredOn={isOn}
    onAudioData={setAudioData}
    onError={(error) => console.error(`Station ${selectedStation.id} error:`, error)}
  />
)}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Only renders the audio player when `selectedStation` is not `null`
- When power button is clicked, `isOn` becomes `true` but `selectedStation` is still `null`
- No audio player is rendered, so no audio plays
- When a station is clicked, `selectedStation` is set and the player is rendered
- Audio starts playing only after explicit station selection

## üêõ Bug 2: Double Audio When Clicking a Station

### **Problem:**
- Clicking a station after radio was already playing started a second audio stream
- Both streams played simultaneously (overlapping/double audio)
- First audio source continued until it eventually stopped on its own

### **Root Cause:**
1. **Multiple audio elements:** Previously, we rendered one `<audio>` element per station (2 elements total)
2. **Web Audio API conflict:** Each player tried to create a `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` from its audio element
3. **No cleanup:** When switching stations, the previous audio element wasn't properly stopped before the new one started

### **Fix Applied:**

**File:** `src/app/stations/page.tsx` (lines 392-402)
- Changed from rendering multiple players to rendering only ONE player at a time
- The `key={selectedStation.id}` ensures React unmounts the old player and mounts a new one when switching stations

**File:** `src/components/radio/SecureAudioPlayer.tsx` (lines 123-233)

**Before:**
```typescript
if (isActive && isPoweredOn) {
  // Set source and play
  const streamUrl = `/api/stream/${stationId}`;
  const fullUrl = new URL(streamUrl, window.location.origin).href;

  // Only set src if it's different to avoid reloading
  if (audio.src !== fullUrl) {
    audio.src = streamUrl;
  }

  audio.play().catch((err) => {
    // ...
  });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (isActive && isPoweredOn) {
  // Stop any existing playback first to prevent double audio
  audio.pause();
  
  // Cancel any existing animation frames
  if (animationFrameRef.current) {
    cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameRef.current);
    animationFrameRef.current = undefined;
  }

  // Set source and play
  const streamUrl = `/api/stream/${stationId}`;
  
  // Always set the src to ensure we're loading the correct stream
  audio.src = streamUrl;
  audio.load(); // Explicitly load the new source

  audio.play().catch((err) => {
    // ...
  });
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Only ONE audio element exists at any time
- When switching stations, React unmounts the old player (cleanup runs)
- New player is mounted with the new station's stream
- No overlap or double audio possible

## üêõ Bug 3: Audio Artifacts When Switching Stations

### **Problem:**
- Switching stations caused audio artifacts (reverb, echo, multiple streams)
- Audio quality degraded during and after the switch
- Unclear if related to Bug 2 or separate issue

### **Root Cause:**
1. **Multiple Web Audio API contexts:** Each player created its own `AudioContext`
2. **Shared audio elements:** Multiple `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` instances tried to connect to the same audio element
3. **Incomplete cleanup:** Animation frames and audio buffers weren't properly cleared

### **Fix Applied:**

**File:** `src/components/radio/SecureAudioPlayer.tsx` (lines 123-233)

**Key Changes:**

1. **Explicit cleanup before playback:**
```typescript
// Stop any existing playback first to prevent double audio
audio.pause();

// Cancel any existing animation frames
if (animationFrameRef.current) {
  cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameRef.current);
  animationFrameRef.current = undefined;
}
```

2. **Explicit buffer clearing:**
```typescript
// Always set the src to ensure we're loading the correct stream
audio.src = streamUrl;
audio.load(); // Explicitly load the new source
```

3. **Improved stop logic:**
```typescript
else {
  // Stop playback immediately when not active or powered off
  audio.pause();
  audio.src = '';
  audio.load(); // Clear the buffer

  setState(prev => ({ ...prev, isPlaying: false, isLoading: false }));

  // Cancel animation frame
  if (animationFrameRef.current) {
    cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameRef.current);
    animationFrameRef.current = undefined;
  }

  // Clear reconnect timeout
  if (reconnectTimeoutRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(reconnectTimeoutRef.current);
    reconnectTimeoutRef.current = undefined;
  }
}
```

4. **Error handling for Web Audio API:**
```typescript
// Initialize audio context on first interaction (only once per audio element)
if (!audioContextRef.current) {
  try {
    const AudioContext = window.AudioContext || ...;
    const audioContext = new AudioContext();
    audioContextRef.current = audioContext;
    
    // Create source node (can only be created once per audio element)
    const source = audioContext.createMediaElementSource(audio);
    // ... rest of setup
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('[SecureAudioPlayer] Failed to initialize Web Audio API:', err);
    // Continue without Web Audio API features
  }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Only ONE `AudioContext` exists at any time
- Only ONE `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` per audio element
- Proper cleanup prevents buffer artifacts
- Explicit `audio.load()` clears any cached audio data
- React's unmount/mount cycle ensures clean state

## üìä Technical Improvements

### **Architecture Change:**

**Before:**
```
Power On ‚Üí Render 2 audio players ‚Üí All players receive isPoweredOn=true
         ‚Üí Player 1: isActive=false, isPoweredOn=true
         ‚Üí Player 2: isActive=false, isPoweredOn=true
         ‚Üí Potential for race conditions and conflicts
```

**After:**
```
Power On ‚Üí selectedStation=null ‚Üí No audio player rendered
Click Station ‚Üí selectedStation=station1 ‚Üí Render ONE audio player
              ‚Üí Player: isActive=true, isPoweredOn=true
              ‚Üí Clean, single source of truth
```

### **Benefits:**

1. ‚úÖ **Single Source of Truth:** Only one audio element at a time
2. ‚úÖ **Clean State Management:** React handles unmount/mount automatically
3. ‚úÖ **No Race Conditions:** Impossible to have multiple streams playing
4. ‚úÖ **Better Performance:** Only one Web Audio API context
5. ‚úÖ **Cleaner Code:** Simpler logic, easier to debug
6. ‚úÖ **Proper Cleanup:** React's lifecycle ensures cleanup runs
