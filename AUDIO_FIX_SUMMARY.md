# 🎉 Audio Playback Issue - COMPLETELY FIXED!

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Issue:** Audio was not playing, with "MEDIA_ELEMENT_ERROR: Empty src attribute" errors appearing in console.

**Root Cause:** The cleanup function was clearing `audio.src = ''`, which caused the audio element to enter an invalid state when components remounted during station switching.

**Solution:** Removed all instances of `audio.src = ''` from cleanup and inactive state handling. The audio element now maintains its src value, and only pauses during cleanup.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED AND TESTED**

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

### **The Critical Error**

```
[SecureAudioPlayer] ❌ error event fired: MediaError {
  code: 4, 
  message: 'MEDIA_ELEMENT_ERROR: Empty src attribute'
}
```

### **The Root Cause**

Three places in the code were clearing the audio src:

1. **Cleanup function (Line 410):**
   ```typescript
   return () => {
     if (audio) {
       audio.pause();
       audio.src = '';  // ← PROBLEM!
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Inactive state handling (Line 378):**
   ```typescript
   } else {
     audio.pause();
     audio.src = '';  // ← PROBLEM!
     audio.load();
   }
   ```

3. **Double-loading check wasn't working:**
   ```typescript
   if (isLoadingRef.current && audio.src.includes(stationId)) {
     return; // This never triggered
   }
   ```

### **Why This Caused the Bug**

When switching stations:
1. User clicks Station 2
2. Component with `key="1"` unmounts → Cleanup runs → `audio.src = ''`
3. Component with `key="2"` mounts → Sets `audio.src = '/api/stream/2'`
4. React Strict Mode → Second useEffect runs → Tries to set src again
5. Audio element is in bad state → **"Empty src attribute" error**
6. Audio fails to load → **No playback**

## ✅ What We Fixed

### **Fix 1: Removed src Clearing from Cleanup**

**Before:**
```typescript
return () => {
  if (audio) {
    audio.pause();
    audio.src = '';  // ← REMOVED
  }
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
return () => {
  console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Cleanup running for station:', stationId);
  
  if (audio) {
    audio.pause();
    // Don't clear src - let the new component set its own src
  }
};
```

### **Fix 2: Removed src Clearing from Inactive State**

**Before:**
```typescript
} else {
  audio.pause();
  audio.src = '';  // ← REMOVED
  audio.load();
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} else {
  console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Component not active, pausing audio');
  audio.pause();
  // Don't clear src - it causes errors
}
```

### **Fix 3: Improved Double-Loading Prevention**

**Before:**
```typescript
if (isLoadingRef.current && audio.src.includes(stationId)) {
  return;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (audio.src === `http://localhost:3000${streamUrl}` || audio.src === streamUrl) {
  console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Already loading this station, skipping duplicate load');
  console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Current src:', audio.src, 'Target src:', streamUrl);
  return;
}
```
