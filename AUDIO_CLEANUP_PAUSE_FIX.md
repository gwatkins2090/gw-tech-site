# 🐛 Audio Playback Fix: Cleanup Pausing Audio Prematurely

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Issue:** Audio was not playing despite `audio.play()` promise resolving successfully. Windows audio mixer showed the browser tab with audio controls, but no sound was audible.

**Root Cause:** The cleanup function was pausing the audio element during React Strict Mode's "remount" phase, preventing audio from ever actually playing.

**Solution:** Modified cleanup to only pause audio when actually switching stations, not during React Strict Mode remounts.

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **The Problem Sequence**

From the console logs:

```
[SecureAudioPlayer] Setting audio source: /api/stream/1
[SecureAudioPlayer] Audio source set and load() called
[SecureAudioPlayer] Cleanup running for station: 1  ← CLEANUP RUNS!
[SecureAudioPlayer] useEffect triggered (again)
[SecureAudioPlayer] Already loading this station, skipping duplicate load
[SecureAudioPlayer] play() called
[SecureAudioPlayer] ✅ audio.play() promise resolved successfully!
```

**What was happening:**

1. **First useEffect** → Sets `audio.src = '/api/stream/1'`, calls `audio.load()`
2. **React Strict Mode** → Triggers cleanup → **`audio.pause()` is called**
3. **Second useEffect** → Skips setting src (already set)
4. **play() is called** → Promise resolves
5. **But audio was paused by cleanup** → No sound plays!

### **Why This Happened**

The cleanup function had an empty dependency array:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
useEffect(() => {
  const audio = audioRef.current; // Captured at mount time
  
  return () => {
    if (audio) {
      audio.pause(); // ← This runs during React Strict Mode remount!
    }
  };
}, []); // Empty deps = cleanup runs on every remount
```

**React Strict Mode behavior:**
- In development, React intentionally mounts → unmounts → remounts components
- This triggers the cleanup function even though the component isn't actually being removed
- Our cleanup was pausing the audio during this "fake" unmount

### **Evidence**

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ `audio.play()` promise resolved successfully
- ✅ Windows audio mixer showed browser tab with controls
- ✅ No console errors
- ❌ No actual audio from speakers/headphones
- ❌ Audio element was paused immediately after loading

**Console logs showed:**
```
[SecureAudioPlayer] Cleanup running for station: 1
```
This was running BEFORE the audio had a chance to play!

## ✅ The Solution

### **Fix: Smart Cleanup Detection**

Modified the cleanup function to detect whether it's a real unmount (station change) or a React Strict Mode remount:

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED):
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Cleanup running for station:', stationId);

    // Get current ref values at cleanup time (not mount time)
    const audio = audioRef.current;
    
    if (audio) {
      const currentSrc = audio.src;
      
      // Only pause if the src has changed (meaning we're switching stations)
      if (!currentSrc.includes(stationId)) {
        console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Station changed, pausing audio');
        audio.pause();
      } else {
        console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Same station, NOT pausing (React Strict Mode remount)');
      }
    }
    
    // ... rest of cleanup
  };
}, [stationId]); // Include stationId dependency
```

**Key changes:**

1. **Get refs at cleanup time, not mount time:**
   ```typescript
   // Before: const audio = audioRef.current; (at mount)
   // After: const audio = audioRef.current; (in cleanup function)
   ```

2. **Check if station changed:**
   ```typescript
   if (!currentSrc.includes(stationId)) {
     audio.pause(); // Only pause if switching stations
   }
   ```

3. **Add stationId to dependencies:**
   ```typescript
   }, [stationId]); // Was: }, []);
   ```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **File Modified:**

✅ `src/components/radio/SecureAudioPlayer.tsx`

### **Changes Made:**

#### **Change: Smart Cleanup Function (Lines 401-447)**

**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Capture ref values at mount time for cleanup
  const audio = audioRef.current;
  const animationFrame = animationFrameRef.current;
  const reconnectTimeout = reconnectTimeoutRef.current;
  const audioContext = audioContextRef.current;

  return () => {
    console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Cleanup running for station:', stationId);

    if (audio) {
      audio.pause(); // ← Always paused, even during remount!
    }

    // ... rest of cleanup
  };
}, []); // Empty deps
```

**After:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Cleanup running for station:', stationId);

    // Get current ref values at cleanup time (not mount time)
    const audio = audioRef.current;
    const animationFrame = animationFrameRef.current;
    const reconnectTimeout = reconnectTimeoutRef.current;
    const audioContext = audioContextRef.current;

    // Only pause if we're actually unmounting (station is changing)
    if (audio) {
      const currentSrc = audio.src;
      
      // Only pause if the src has changed (meaning we're switching stations)
      if (!currentSrc.includes(stationId)) {
        console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Station changed, pausing audio');
        audio.pause();
      } else {
        console.log('[SecureAudioPlayer] Same station, NOT pausing (React Strict Mode remount)');
      }
    }

    // Cancel animation frame
    if (animationFrame) {
      cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrame);
    }

    // Clear reconnect timeout
    if (reconnectTimeout) {
      clearTimeout(reconnectTimeout);
    }

    // Close audio context (check if it's not already closed)
    if (audioContext && audioContext.state !== 'closed') {
      audioContext.close().catch((err) => {
        console.debug('[SecureAudioPlayer] AudioContext close error (safe to ignore):', err);
      });
    }
  };
}, [stationId]); // Include stationId dependency
```

## 📊 Before vs After

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Audio Playback** | ❌ No sound (paused by cleanup) | ✅ Audio plays correctly |
| **React Strict Mode** | ❌ Cleanup pauses audio | ✅ Cleanup skips pause |
| **Station Switching** | ❌ Audio paused too early | ✅ Audio paused only when switching |
| **Console Logs** | ❌ "Cleanup running" before play | ✅ "NOT pausing (remount)" |

## 🎯 Technical Details

### **React Strict Mode Behavior**

In development mode, React Strict Mode:
1. Mounts component
2. Unmounts component (runs cleanup)
3. Remounts component

This helps detect side effects and memory leaks.

**Our issue:** The cleanup was pausing audio during step 2, preventing playback.

**Our fix:** Detect if it's a real unmount (station change) or fake unmount (remount).

### **Detection Logic**

```typescript
if (!currentSrc.includes(stationId)) {
  // Src changed → Real unmount (station switch) → Pause
  audio.pause();
} else {
  // Src same → Fake unmount (React Strict Mode) → Don't pause
  // Audio continues loading and will play
}
```
